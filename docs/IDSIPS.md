## IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention System)

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) play pivotal roles in monitoring, detecting, and mitigating potential threats. These security measures are essential components, often integrated into next-generation firewalls (NGFW), to fortify network defenses against unauthorized access and malicious activities.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** IDS involves the continuous monitoring of network traffic to identify signs of potential intrusions or imminent threats. It analyzes network activities, such as exploit attempts, to detect incidents that may compromise the security of the network.

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** IPS extends the capabilities of IDS by not only detecting incidents but actively preventing them. This involves taking measures such as dropping malicious packets or terminating suspicious sessions to thwart potential threats.


### Benefits of IDS/IPS

**Monitoring for Malicious Behavior:** IDS/IPS monitors all network traffic, identifying known malicious behavior and potential threats. This proactive approach is crucial for early threat detection.

**Blocking Exploit Attempts:** Attackers often attempt to exploit vulnerabilities within devices or software. IDS/IPS identifies and blocks these exploit attempts before they can compromise network endpoints.

**Necessary Security Technologies:** Deployed at the network edge and within data centers, IDS/IPS are indispensable security technologies. They act as a frontline defense, stopping attackers during the information-gathering phase.



### Types of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) serve as critical components in network security, providing vigilant monitoring to identify and respond to potential threats. There are various types of IDS, each tailored to specific aspects of network and host security.

**Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**

- NIDS is strategically placed within the network to analyze traffic from all devices on the network.
- It monitors the entire network for signs of attacks or abnormal activities.
- Alerts are generated and sent to administrators when potential threats are detected.

- Comprehensive Network Coverage.
- Centralized Monitoring and Analysis.
- Focuses on Network-Wide Anomalies.

**Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**

- HIDS operates on individual hosts or devices within the network.
- It monitors both incoming and outgoing traffic on specific hosts.
- Alerts administrators when suspicious activities, anomalies, or potential threats are detected on a specific host.

- Host-Centric Monitoring.
- Provides Detailed Insights into Individual Hosts.
- Enhanced Visibility into Host-Level Anomalies.

**Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS)**

- PIDS focuses on examining the protocols employed between users or devices and servers.
- It checks for any deviations or abnormalities in the communication protocols.
- Alerts are triggered when protocol violations or anomalies are detected.

- Protocol-Centric Monitoring.
- Emphasizes Protocol-Level Anomalies.
- Targets Suspicious Communication Patterns.
